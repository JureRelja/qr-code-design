This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). I added few of my touches to the project and made it to generate a QR code from the link that you input.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I am just starting to use Tailwind. I find it much faster and very intuitive and will surely continue to use it in the future.
